* Wordcount Mode

This is a minor mode to provide a 'wc' function for Emacs buffers as
well as a modeline addition with live word, line and character counts.

Additionally, a user can set specific goals for adding or deleting
words.  These goals were partly inspired by [[http://750words.com][750words.com]] where the
goal of the site is to encourage writing by setting a goal of 750
words at a time.  I wanted the same functionality in Emacs.

* Installation

  Obtain the package from Github
  
: git clone git://github.com/bnbeckwith/wc-mode.git

  Then, add to your Emacs setup.

: ;; Add the path to the repo
: (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/wc-mode/")
: (require 'wc-mode)
: ;; Suggested setting
: (global-set-key "\C-cw" 'wc-mode)

  The code above sets up the minor mode and then assigns a global key
  to toggle the mode on and off.
