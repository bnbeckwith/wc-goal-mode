# Wordcount Mode #

This is a minor mode to provide a 'wc' function for Emacs buffers as
well as a modeline addition with live word, line and character counts.

Additionally, a user can set specific goals for adding or deleting
words.  These goals were partly inspired by [http://750.com](750.com)
where the goal of the site is to encourage writing by setting a goal
of 750 words at a time.  I wanted the same functionality in Emacs.
